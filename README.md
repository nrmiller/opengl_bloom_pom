## About the Project

This project was completed as part of an independent study during my time in university. The goal for the project was to create an OpenGL Core profile application showcasing advanced shading techniques such as normal mapping, bloom effect, and parallax occlusion mapping.

For the complete write-up on the project, please review the [Technical Description](doc/Technical%20Description.pdf).

## Using the application

While running, there are a few ways to interact with the scene:

- `R` - resets the scene to the default view and positions
- `Esc` - show/hide the cursor
- `W/A/S/D` - pans the camera
- `mouse movement` - rotates the camera
- `I/J/K/L/U/O` - moves the brick cube
- `4/6/2/8 (num pad)` - rotates the brick cube
- `N` - enables/disables the normal mapping shader
- `B` - enables/disables the bloom shader
- `P` - enables/disables the parallax occlusion mapping shader
